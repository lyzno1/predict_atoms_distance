Here, we use [Ax/SAASBO Bayesian adaptive design](https://ax.dev/tutorials/saasbo.html) to simultaneously optimize 23 hyperparameters of [CrabNet](https://crabnet.readthedocs.io/). `100` sequential design iterations were used, and parameters were chosen based on a combination of intuition and algorithm/data constraints (e.g. elemental featurizers which were missing elements contained in the dataset were removed). The first `10` iterations were based on SOBOL sampling to create a rough initial model, while the remaining `90` iterations were SAASBO Bayesian adaptive design iterations. For the innerloops (where hyperparameter optimization is performed), the average MAE across each of the *five inner folds* was used as Ax's objective to minimize. The best parameter set was then trained on all the inner fold data and used to predict on the test set (unknown during hyperparameter optimization). This is nested cross-validation (CV), and is computationally expensive. See [automatminer: running a benchmark](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/automatminer/advanced.html#running-a-benchmark) for more information on nested CV.",
